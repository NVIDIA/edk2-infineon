 *  @brief  Implementation of TPM2_StartAuthSession command.
 *
 *  @retval TPM_RC_ATTRIBUTES               tpmKey does not reference a decrypt key.
 *  @retval TPM_RC_CONTEXT_GAP              the difference between the most recently created active context and the oldest active context is at the limits of the TPM.
 *  @retval TPM_RC_HANDLE                   input decrypt key handle only has public portion loaded.
 *  @retval TPM_RC_MODE                     symmetric specifies a block cipher but the mode is not TPM_ALG_CFB.
 *  @retval TPM_RC_SESSION_HANDLES          no session handle is available.
 *  @retval TPM_RC_SESSION_MEMORY           no more slots for loading a session.
 *  @retval TPM_RC_SIZE                     nonce less than 16 octets or greater than the size of the digest produced by authHash.
 *  @retval TPM_RC_VALUE                    secret size does not match decrypt key type; or the recovered secret is larger than the digest size of the nameAlg of tpmKey; or, for an RSA decrypt key, if encryptedSecret is greater than the public exponent of tpmKey.
